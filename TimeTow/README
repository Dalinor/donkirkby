It's been a while, but I think I saved the Google Doc version of the rules
as HTML, saved the spreadsheet as HTML, and manually merged them together.
Once the merged HTML is committed to the repository, you can use an online
converter to create the PDF.

The output files have now moved to the gh-pages branch for hosting.

This library ports the [multithreadedtc library](https://code.google.com/p/multithreadedtc/) from Java to .NET. You can download the Ticking Test source code from [the repository](https://code.google.com/p/donkirkby/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FTickingTest), and you will find an example multi-threaded class with some test cases.

The library lets you declare a method for each thread that you want to run, and then coordinate the timing of the thread execution with checkpoints called ticks.
